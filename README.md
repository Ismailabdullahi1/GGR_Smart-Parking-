# Smart Parking System - Final Year Project

## Overview

The **Smart Parking System** is an innovative solution designed to improve the efficiency and user experience of parking in a modern, automated way. The project focuses on providing real-time parking availability, reservation capabilities, and dynamic payment methods. It is built as a web-based system that can be easily integrated with parking infrastructure to manage car and motorcycle parking spots.

This project is currently in progress and is being developed as part of my **Bachelor of Software Engineering** program at **Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia**.
